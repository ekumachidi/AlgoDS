##Solution:

###Iteration #1:

1. We first check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, they cannot be anagrams, and we return false.
2. We create an array char_count of size 26 (assuming only lowercase English letters) to store the count of each character.
3. We iterate through the first string s and update the character counts in the array.
4. We iterate through the second string t and decrement the character counts in the array.
5. After both iterations, we check if all character counts in the array are zero. If they are, it indicates that the strings are anagrams.

###Iteration #2: to handle unicode characters

1. We first check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, they cannot be anagrams, and we return false.
2. We use a hash table char_count to store character counts, where the key is the Unicode code point of the character.
3. During the iteration through the strings, we update and decrement the character counts in the hash table.
4. The final check ensures that all character counts are zero, indicating that the strings are anagrams.
5. After both iterations, we check if all character counts in the array are zero. If they are, it indicates that the strings are anagrams.

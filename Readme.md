# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

This repository is dedicated to my practice of algorithms and data structures, primarily using questions from LeetCode. I aim to strengthen my problem-solving skills and improve my understanding of various algorithms and data structures by solving a variety of problems.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by months. Within the directory, there'd be a file containing the LeetCode problem and files with similar name for the solutions implemented in both Ruby and C#.

## Languages Used

- **Ruby**: Solutions implemented in Ruby programming language.
- **C#**: Solutions implemented in C# programming language.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute by adding more solutions, improving existing solutions, or adding explanations, feel free to follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new solution for ProblemX in Ruby'`.
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-solution`.
6. Submit a pull request.

Your contributions are highly appreciated!
